# ARFF.jl Documentation

Documentation for the adaptive random fourier features (ARFF) package.  This package is built around the methodology presented in [kammonen_adaptive_2020](@cite).

Using the package involves three steps:
* Formatting your training data into a `DataSet` structure
* Initializing a `FourierModel` structure
* Training
