                  Estimates of the generalization error are proved for a residual neural network with \$L\$ random Fourier features layers \${\textbackslash}bar z\_\{{\textbackslash}ell +1\}={\textbackslash}bar z\_{\textbackslash}ell + {\textbackslash}textrm \{Re\}{\textbackslash}sum \_\{k=1\}{\textasciicircum}K{\textbackslash}bar b\_\{{\textbackslash}ell k\}{\textbackslash},e{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textrm \{i\}{\textbackslash}omega \_\{{\textbackslash}ell k\}{\textbackslash}bar z\_{\textbackslash}ell \}+ {\textbackslash}textrm \{Re\}{\textbackslash}sum \_\{k=1\}{\textasciicircum}K{\textbackslash}bar c\_\{{\textbackslash}ell k\}{\textbackslash},e{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textrm \{i\}{\textbackslash}omega {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}\_\{{\textbackslash}ell k\}{\textbackslash}cdot x\}\$. An optimal distribution for the frequencies \$({\textbackslash}omega \_\{{\textbackslash}ell k\},{\textbackslash}omega {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}\_\{{\textbackslash}ell k\})\$ of the random Fourier features \$e{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textrm \{i\}{\textbackslash}omega \_\{{\textbackslash}ell k\}{\textbackslash}bar z\_{\textbackslash}ell \}\$ and \$e{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textrm \{i\}{\textbackslash}omega {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}\_\{{\textbackslash}ell k\}{\textbackslash}cdot x\}\$ is derived. This derivation is based on the corresponding generalization error for the approximation of the function values \$f(x)\$. The generalization error turns out to be smaller than the estimate \$\{{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}hat f{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2\_\{L{\textasciicircum}1(\{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\}\}{\textasciicircum}d)\}\}/\{({KL})\}\$ of the generalization error for random Fourier features, with one hidden layer and the same total number of nodes \${KL}\$, in the case of the \$L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}infty \$-norm of \$f\$ is much less than the \$L{\textasciicircum}1\$-norm of its Fourier transform \${\textbackslash}hat f\$. This understanding of an optimal distribution for random features is used to construct a new training method for a deep residual network. Promising performance of the proposed new algorithm is demonstrated in computational experiments.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents an enhanced adaptive random Fourier features (ARFF) training algorithm for shallow neural networks, building upon the work introduced in "Adaptive Random Fourier Features with Metropolis Sampling", Kammonen et al., Foundations of Data Science, 2(3):309--332, 2020. This improved method uses a particle filter type resampling technique to stabilize the training process and reduce sensitivity to parameter choices. With resampling, the Metropolis test may also be omitted, reducing the number of hyperparameters and reducing the computational cost per iteration, compared to ARFF. We present comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed algorithm in function regression tasks, both as a standalone method and as a pre-training step before gradient-based optimization, here Adam. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to a simple image regression problem, showcasing its utility in sampling frequencies for the random Fourier features (RFF) layer of coordinate-based multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). In this context, we use the proposed algorithm to sample the parameters of the RFF layer in an automated manner.},
